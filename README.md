<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Keystone Percentage Helper is an addon designed to assist players in tracking enemy forces percentage during Mythic+ dungeon runs. Originally inspired by the WeakAura [WA RM+](https://wago.io/4pHPrk9NM), this WeakAura has been rewritten as a standalone addon to provide better performance and reliability.

The addon helps you optimize your routes by:
- Displaying the current enemy forces percentage
- Showing target percentages for each boss
- Warning you and your group when approaching important percentage thresholds
- Supporting all current season dungeons and previous expansions
- Allowing full customization of percentage targets for each dungeon

Whether you're a seasoned Mythic+ runner or just starting out, this addon helps ensure you reach the required enemy forces percentage at the right time, making your runs more efficient and organized.

### Why an Addon Instead of a WeakAura?
While the original WeakAura served its purpose well, converting it to a standalone addon brings several significant advantages:
- **Better Performance**: Uses significantly less memory and CPU resources compared to the WeakAura version
- **Faster Response**: More reactive to game events, providing real-time percentage updates
- **Easier Maintenance**: Structured codebase makes it easier to update for new seasons and expansions
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Built using WoW's addon framework for more stable operation
